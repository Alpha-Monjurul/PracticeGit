            <h1>AQUASCAPING</h1>
            <p>Aquascaping is the craft of arranging aquatic plants, as well as rocks, stones, driftwood, in an
                aesthetically pleasing manner within an aquarium. Aquascape designs include a number of distinct styles,
                including the garden-like Dutch style and the Japanese-inspired nature style. Aaquascape houses fish as
                well as plants, although it is possible to create an aquascape with plants only, or with rockwork or
                other hardscape and no plants. Although the primary aim of aquascaping is to create an artful underwater
                landscape, the technical aspects of tank maintenance and the growth requirements of aquatic plants are
                also taken into consideration.</p>
